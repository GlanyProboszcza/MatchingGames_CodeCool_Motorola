​​MatchingGames

I am barely starting to code and this is my very first program in C#.
For the last 6 months I have been participating in HakerU Academy for Red Team Specialists.
During that academy I have been intensely learning many IT-related concepts, some of which were Python and Javascript basics.
This game was written not entirely according to the requirements, for a couple of reasons:
1. Due to HakerU Academy I had only one effective day to work on this game.
2. I have never had any previous experience with C# (nor other object programming to be exact)
3. There was a credible tutorial on writing this game on Microsoft Docs (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-windows-forms-create-match-game?view=vs-2022)
4. Going with the Graphical version I will hopefully add enough value to compensate for the lack of other features/requirements. 
I am sure that given more time I could implement these requirements in my GUI-version of the MatchingGame.
